## NLP Text Preprocessing

This repository contains text preprocessing techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. Text preprocessing is crucial to clean and prepare textual data for analysis and machine learning. 
This README provides a brief overview of the steps involved.

### Sample Dataset

To get started with text preprocessing, you can use the provided sample dataset, "sample.csv." This dataset contains text data that you can use to practice and apply the text preprocessing techniques outlined in this README. You can find the sample dataset in the root of this repository.

### Text Cleaning

Text cleaning involves several key steps:

1. **Converting to Lowercase**: All text data is converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity.

2. **Removing URLs**: URLs are eliminated using regular expressions to remove irrelevant information from the text.

3. **Removing Non-Word and Non-Whitespace Characters**: Special characters, symbols, and punctuation marks are removed, reducing noise in the data.

4. **Removing Digits**: Numerical digits are removed from the text data to enhance the accuracy of text analysis.

### Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words, making it more manageable for analysis. This step enhances the understanding of underlying patterns in the text.

### Stopword Removal

Common stopwords, such as "and," "the," and "is," are removed from the text data to improve the accuracy of NLP models. This not only reduces noise but also reduces the dataset's size, resulting in faster model training.

### Stemming/Lemmatization

Choose between stemming and lemmatization based on your project requirements:

- **Stemming**: Reduces words to their root form, improving text analysis. The Porter Stemmer algorithm is commonly used.

- **Lemmatization**: Focuses on converting words to their base form while considering the context. Lemmatization is often used for better semantic understanding.

These preprocessing techniques transform unstructured text data into a structured and clean format, making it suitable for NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and topic modeling.

### Usage

You can apply these techniques to your own text data by implementing the provided code examples. Simply adapt the code to your specific dataset and project needs.

### Conclusion

Effective text preprocessing is a crucial step in NLP projects, improving data quality and the performance of NLP models. Whether you need to clean, tokenize, remove stopwords, or perform stemming or lemmatization, these techniques prepare your text data for more accurate analysis and model development.


Feel free to adapt and extend these techniques for your own NLP projects. Happy text preprocessing!
